## Background

I'm a developer, currently software engineering as my day (and only) job.

I've studied Computer Networks and Protocols, Computer's Architecture, the State and Fundamentals of IT, Software development, Web Development and, as of, recently a masters in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data.

My experience with Python, while not necessarily being the roundest of them all, it's a bit horizontal you could say. I've done personal and educational projects, and I've automated workflows in a profesional environment.
